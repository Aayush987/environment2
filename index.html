        <h2>GEOGRAPHICAL ENVIRONMENT</h2>
        <p id="p2">
            Geographical environment is the terrestrial environment that is a creation of complex natural and environmental conditions. Although it arose independently of humankind, it is the complement of direct interaction between nature and human society. The geographical environment revolves around the subjects of climatology, geology, biogeography, etc. They are direct aspects of how human society conceptualizes the geography of the earth.


A geographical environment is also called a natural environment as it interacts with nature. The earthâ€™s surface, rivers, mountains, deserts, land, water, oceans, volcanoes, etc. come under the natural environment examples.
